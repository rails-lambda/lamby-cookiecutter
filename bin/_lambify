# Many of these bin scripts facilitate usage of Docker. Take note
# of the convention where scripts with a leading _ are run inside
# the container. Exampele: the ./bin/test files calls ./bin/_test
# This means if you wanted to go platform native, sans-Docker, you
# can use the _ scripts directly. Details:
#
# - Project bootstrap & setup conventions.
# - Build and deploy scripts using SAM
# - Simple `./bin/server` and `./bin/test` wrappers.
# - Use `./bin/run` to run any ad-hoc command.

# It is far easier to get started with basic a `SECRET_KEY_BASE`
# environment variable vs encrypted credentials. The value here is
# garbage and should be changed prior to real usage.

# Add a getting started .env.development Dotenv file. This has one

# These Docker files setup both a local development & build
# environment using docker-compose. The dev/build file is named
# `Dockerfile-build` and this is what compose uses. The main
# `Dockerfile` is used to build your production image. Keeping your
# image small and free of unneeded files is an important part
# of deploying containers. As such, this main Dockerfile does
# a simple copy of your built application into it.

# We replace the Gemfile in whole for a few reasons:
#
# - Remove `ruby` declaration. Helps minor udpates
# - Add Lamby gem along with Dotenv.
# - Add lograge gem to reduce CloudWatch noise/costs.
